            <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe <abbr title="MCU">(MCU)</abbr> is an American media franchise and shared
                universe centered on
                a series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that
                appear
                in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series,
                short
                films,
                digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like
                the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements,
                settings, cast, and characters. </p>

            <p>Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases", with the first three phases collectively
                known as "The Infinity Saga" and the following three phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The first MCU
                film,
                Iron Man (2008), began Phase One, which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers.
                Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015).
                Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From
                Home (2019).
                Phase Four began with Black Widow (2021) and concluded with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022).
                Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) began Phase Five, which will end with Captain America:
                Brave New World (2025), and Phase Six will begin with Fantastic Four (2025).
                Phase Six and "The Multiverse Saga" will conclude with Avengers 5 (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars
                (2027).</p>

            <p>n June 2010, Marvel Television was launched with Jeph Loeb as head. By July 2012, Marvel Television
                had entered into discussions with ABC to create a show set in the MCU; the network ultimately created
                the series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter,[54] and Inhumans, which was a co-production with IMAX
                Corporation. In November 2013, Disney was set to provide Netflix with the live-action series Daredevil,
                Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, leading up to the miniseries The Defenders. In April 2016,
                Netflix ordered The Punisher, a spin-off of Daredevil. By February 2019, Netflix had canceled all of
                its Marvel series.[60] In April 2016, the Disney-owned cable network Freeform announced Cloak & Dagger.
                In May 2017, Marvel announced that Runaways had received a series order from Hulu. In May 2019, Marvel
                announced that Helstrom had been greenlit for Hulu.</p>

            <p>Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013
                before further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu and to cable television on
                Freeform.
                They also produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios began producing
                their
                own television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of
                Phase Four. They also expanded to television specials in Phase Four, known as Marvel Studios Special
                Presentations, the first of which was Werewolf by Night (2022). The MCU also includes tie-in comics
                published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, and viral
                marketing campaigns for the films featuring the faux news programs WHIH Newsfront and The Daily Bugle.

                The franchise has been commercially successful, becoming one of the highest-grossing media franchises of
                all time, and generally received positive reviews. It has inspired other film and television studios to
                attempt similar shared universes and has also inspired several themed attractions, an art exhibit,
                television specials, literary material, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials. </p>
